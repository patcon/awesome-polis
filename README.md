----
_Unlike some Awesome Lists, since the Polis development and practitioner
community is rather nascent and disconnected, this list will start off as very
COMPREHENSIVE, rather than CURATED. This means it will include code or projects
even marginally related to Polis. This will include non-functional projects. At
some point, once there is more maturity in the ecosystem, inactive or
incomplete projects will likely migrated in a less prominent collaborative
spreadsheet also listed amongst these resources._
